![[852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array.png]]

---
## Solution

### Approach :

- Given a mountain array hence we can solve this with binary search
- `Mid` can be in either `increasing` side or `decreasing` side
	- If `increasing` then `start = mid + 1 ` (-> Right)
	- If `decreasing `then `end = mid` (<- Left)
- Both `start` and `end` try to `reach peak` and then at last they `meet` and it is the peak value

NOTE: Mountain array also called as `bitonic` array
### CodeÂ :

```java
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
         int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;
        while(start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]){ 
	            // Increasing -> Right
                start = mid + 1;
            }else{
	            // Decreasing -> Left
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```
