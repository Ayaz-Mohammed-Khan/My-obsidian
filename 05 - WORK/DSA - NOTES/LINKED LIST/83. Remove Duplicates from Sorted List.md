---
## Solution

### Examples :

![[83. Examples.png]]
### Approach :

- While traversing the list 
	- If current Node is head and has a duplicate next to it then simply change head to next Node eliminating the previous head
	- If current Node is not head and has duplicate next Node then set previous next to current next (Disconnecting the current list)
	- If current Node has no duplicate next nodes simply move forward 
### CodeÂ :

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        if(head == null) return null;
        while(curr.next != null){
            if(head.next.val == head.val) head = head.next;
            else if(curr.next.val == curr.val) prev.next = curr.next;
            else prev = curr;
            curr = curr.next;
        }return head;
    }
}
```
