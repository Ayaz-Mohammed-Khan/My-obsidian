## Solution

### Examples :

### Approach :

The **fast and slow pointer technique**, also known as **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm** or the **tortoise and hare algorithm**, is a powerful method used to identify specific traits in data structures such as linked lists, arrays, or graphs. This technique employs two pointers that traverse the data structure at different speeds.
#### How It Works

1. **Pointer Initialization**: Two pointers are initialized at the same starting point, typically the head of a linked list.
2. **Movement Rates**:    
    - The **slow pointer** advances one step at a time.
    - The **fast pointer** moves two steps at a time.
3. **Cycle Detection**: If there is a cycle in the data structure, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. This is analogous to a faster runner (the hare) catching up to a slower runner (the tortoise) on a circular track

NOTE: If we want to find the length of the cycle then we can do it after cycle detection when s == f , we can start moving s till s == f and keep the track of length and this the required length of cycle
### Code :

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode f = head;
        ListNode s = head;
        while(f != null && f.next != null){
            f = f.next.next;
            s = s.next;
            if(f == s) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode f = head;
        ListNode s = head;
        do{
            if(f == null || f.next == null){
                return false;
            }
            f = f.next.next;
            s = s.next;
        }while(f != s);
        return true;
    }
}
```
